# Object Detection using YOLOv8 in Image and Video

This project demonstrates  **object detection** in images and videos using the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** model from the **Ultralytics** library. The goal is to analyze and detect objects in images and videos with high accuracy and real-time performance.

## Project Objectives

- Detect objects in an image using **YOLOv8x**, a state-of-the-art object detection model.
- Display bounding boxes, object labels, and confidence scores.
- Optionally classify an image or analyze detected objects programmatically.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (`pip install ultralytics`)
- **OpenCV** (for image handling)
- **PyTorch** (installed automatically with Ultralytics)

## File Structure
      proj.py
      img.jpeg
      output.jpeg
      provideo.py
      video.mp4

### Installation
# Install dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
### Example Output

After running, an `output.jpg` file is created with:
- Detected objects highlighted
- Class names and confidence scores shown on the image

Console output:
dog confidence:0.98 
person confidence:0.95
